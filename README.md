# Ondare

Ondare is an open source iOS radio app that lets users stream publicly available stations from anywhere in the world.  
The goal is to keep things simple and fast.  
Just pick a station and listen.

You can browse top stations by popularity or search by name, genre, or location.  
The Discover screen helps you find new music, talk, or culture from any country.  
Stations you like can be added to your Library for easy access.

In settings, you can choose a preferred country so your search and discovery results are more relevant.

This project was made to demonstrate architectural thinking and a clean iOS codebase using UIKit and SwiftUI.

**Warning**  
This app uses the open source API from [Radio-Browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info) to list publicly available radio stations. It does not host or modify any audio streams. All stations included are freely accessible on the internet and their content remains the property of their respective owners. The app is completely free and does not monetise the content in any way.
